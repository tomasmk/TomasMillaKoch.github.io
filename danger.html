        <h1>Flooding in Canada</h1>
        <p>
          Of all of the natural hazards/disasters that Canada faces, floods are the most frequent. They can be
          caused by a
          number of external forces and can occur in almost any season. Reasons for flooding include heavy
          rainfall in a
          short period of time, rapid melting of snowpacks when the soil is still frozen, and even dam
          failure. A
          statistic from 2010 revealed that flooding damages amounted to around 2.4 Billion US$. Projections
          for the
          country however estimate that by 2030, that price tag could triple. For example, the flood of
          November, 2021 in
          southern BC could have a price tag of upwards of 9 Billion CAD$ for the cost of rebuilding all that
          damage after
          historic rains struck last November. Undoubtedly, Canada is facing some extremely timely decisions
          to make in
          order to protect both its citizens and its assets from future flooding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some solutions currently proposed include cost-sharing for damage through different branches of
          government.
          However, a more comprehensive plan would be to invest in preventative measures. Other solutions
          could possibly
          include strategic placement of infrastructure to minimize the effect of floods on citizens, no
          matter the scale.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>The Dangers Associated with Flooding</h1>
        <p>
          Varying based on the severity and type of flooding, the potential dangers are numerous. Structural
          damage to property, along
          with electrical damages, contaminated drinking water, and issues with drainage and sewage systems
          are all possible risks to both health
          and safety during and after a flood. While a storm surge is a particularly devastating form of
          flooding, these risks are present even with
          a seemingly minor flood.
        </p>
        <p>
          Above all else, the potential for injury and loss of life, including pets and livestock, is of the
          utmost concern when dealing with a flood situation.
          In North America, flash floods have one of the highest death rates of all major weather events, and
          it is predicted that the
          frequency of flooding may increase throughout the 21st century due to climate change, particularly
          in coastal regions.
        </p>
        <p class="text_link">
          It is more important than ever to <a href="prepare.html">be prepared for a flood</a>, particularly if you live
          in a
          <a href="risk.html">high risk area</a>.

        <br>
        <p>
          In the spring of 2017, Lac St-Pierre in Quebec, a wider section of the St. Lawrence River, flooded.
          The community of Yamachiche was evacuated, and
          although flooding isn't unusual in this area, the extent of this particular flood greatly exceeded
          what residents were used to. Some well-prepared residents
          managed to protect their property as much as possible, but many returned to check on their homes and
          cottages (some by boat) on a daily basis.

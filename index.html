      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hello there and welcome to my portfolio. As you can probably guess by my name plastered everywhere on this site,
        my nmae is Tomas Milla-Koch. I am a remote sensing and all things geospatial enthusiast! If that is not
        interesting to you perhaps I can list off another thing that I like to do; I enjoy making furniture!
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        For my education, I first obtained a BSc. at <a href="#McGill">McGill University</a> in Earth System Science.
        After my undergraduate
        degree, the COVID-19 pnademic hit and I took the time to develop skills I did not know I wanted. Throughout my
        yeaf and a half hiatus from school, I learnt leatherworking, woodworking, organic farming and delved deeper into
        programming. I then went to the <a href="#COGS">Centre of Geographic Sciences (COGS)</a> to accomplish a
        graduate certificate
        program in Remote Sensing.
      </p>
      <br>

        I hope that you enjoy my profile...it was really quite fun to make. If have any comments or want to get into
        contact please check the <a href="#footer">footer</a> at the bottom of the page.

      <h1>COGS</h1>
      <p>Throuhgout my time at COGS, I was introduced to a number of Remote Sensing technologies from open source
        multispectral imagery to hgih resolution drone LiDAR. Here, I learned to use softwares such as PCI Catalyst,
        Microstation, ERDAS Imagine and Global Mapper. Additionally, on the GIS side of things, I learnt to use the Esri
        suite of products for GIS. I also learned to use various programming languages such as Python, R, and Javascript
        to apply to geospatial data.</p>

      <h1>McGill University</h1>
      <p>Throughout my time at McGill, I switched programs a couple of times before finally settling on Earth System
        Science. The program was a muilti disciplinary Earth Sciences program that taught us the interconnectivity of
        all of Earth's components (i.e. Biosphere, cryosphere, etc.). We were also taught how to code entire coupled
        models to mimic these systems numerically.</p>
      <p>I acheived a great deal at McGill University. Sure there were a couple of awards and some
        scholarships but, I am talking about more narrowing down my interests. Towards the end of my undergrad, I got
        involved with the research group <a href="https://www.natalyagomez.com/" target="_blank">Natalya Gomez</a> where
        I studied the
        physics of sea level rise. Additionally, I became interested in geodynamics as a field and especially how it
        related to volcanism.</p>

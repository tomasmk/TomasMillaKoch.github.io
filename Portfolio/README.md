**Mission Statement**

Not only does the FloodRouteFinder app serve as a general informational application that informs users both about dangers of floods in their area, it also provides a guide to the flood resilient infrastructure that exists within their area already. The application assumes a hypothetical disaster scenario in order to provide users with an ideal path to a center with power in the event that power is lost due to inclement weather and flooding (i.e. a hospital or any infrastructure unaffected by power loss or with a generator).


**The FloodRouteFinder Website** 

From the main landing page of our website you can explore the purpose of our app and learn a bit about our team to determine whether this is the solution you need. If it is, there are 3 easy-to-see links/buttons that will take you directly to the FloodRouteFinder app itself. The fixed navigation bar at the top of the screen remains there no matter where you go, so you never get stuck or lost. 

Outside of the FloodRouteFinder app, we want our users to have the information they need at their fingertips when they need it. Our 'Quick Links' pages give the user access to details on how floods can impact them, how to prepare for floods, how to know if they are in an at-risk area, and an interactive map to check for any current flood risks in their area. The map displays the latest changes in precipitation levels, where recent and active floods exist, and predicted sea level rise along the coast. 

Our webpage/s and FloodRouteFinder mapping application are currently supported by all major browsers, and will provide a smooth user experience on any device regardless of screen size. Our products run on open Canadian data, and our maps are powered by the latest Esri technology. 

While our datasets are not yet completely comprehensive, with the MVP of our FloodRouteFinder app currently supporting only our user-base in the city of Toronto, we hope to expand to support other major cities in Canada in order to provide our service to as many people as possible. 

As our team and our app are very new, we welcome any comments and have a contact page dedicated to receiving feedback from our users. 

**How the FloodRouteFinder App Works** 
- Choose which layers you want active on teh web map.
- Identify the flood plains on the map to see whether you live in one. Alternatively, type your address into the search bar to zoom in.
- Create bookmarks within the app to find positions of interest quickly.
- Indentify the best paths calculated by our model to transport people to safety.
- Check the infrastructure that would lead you to safety (i.e. roads, hospitals).
- Additionally, toggle on the Elevation contour layer and pick the swipe widget to see an elevation model of the city and where the city would be likely to flood the most if 
  water levels in Lake Ontario were to rise to "doomsday" levels. 
- Check out our story map to understand the intricacies of our model:
